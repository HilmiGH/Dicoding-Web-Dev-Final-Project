                    Deep-sea mining is the extraction of minerals from the seabed, especially in areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ) or the high seas, which cover almost half of the Earthâ€™s surface and are home to a rich biodiversity and ecosystem services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main targets of deep-sea mining are polymetallic nodules, which are potato-sized rocks that contain metals such as manganese, nickel, copper and cobalt; polymetallic sulphides, which are formed by hydrothermal vents and contain metals such as zinc, lead, silver and gold; and cobalt-rich crusts, which are found on seamounts and contain metals such as cobalt, iron and platinum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The International Seabed Authority (ISA), a UN body that regulates the exploration and exploitation of the seabed in ABNJ, has issued 30 contracts to 21 countries and entities for deep-sea mining exploration. The ISA is also developing a mining code that will set the rules and standards for commercial exploitation, which could start as early as 2024.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, there is growing concern about the environmental and social impacts of deep-sea mining, which could cause irreversible damage to the marine life, habitats and ecosystems in the deep ocean. Some of the potential impacts include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The removal or disturbance of the seabed surface, which could destroy or displace the organisms that live there, such as corals, sponges, worms and crustaceans.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The creation of sediment plumes, which could smother or clog the filter-feeding organisms that depend on clear water, such as corals, sponges and fish.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The release of toxic substances, such as heavy metals, acid and organic matter, which could contaminate the water column and affect the food web and biogeochemical cycles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The noise and light pollution, which could disrupt the behavior and communication of marine animals, such as whales, dolphins and fish.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The loss of genetic resources and potential benefits from bioprospecting, which is the exploration of biological diversity for new drugs, enzymes, materials and other applications.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is also a lack of scientific knowledge and data on the deep-sea environment and its biodiversity, which makes it difficult to assess the risks and uncertainties of deep-sea mining and to monitor its impacts. Moreover, there is a lack of transparency and accountability in the governance and decision-making process of the ISA, which has been criticized for its pro-mining bias and lack of representation of civil society and indigenous peoples.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    There is a growing opposition to deep-sea mining from various stakeholders, such as environmental groups, scientists, indigenous peoples, small island states, fishing communities and consumers. They are calling for a moratorium or ban on deep-sea mining until more research is done and more safeguards are put in place. They are also advocating for alternative solutions to meet the demand for minerals, such as reducing consumption, recycling, circular economy and green technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is also a growing recognition of the need to protect the ocean commons from exploitation and degradation, and to ensure its conservation and sustainable use for present and future generations. There are several initiatives underway to achieve this goal, such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) process, which is a UN negotiation to develop a legally binding instrument for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in ABNJ. The BBNJ agreement could include provisions for marine protected areas (MPAs), environmental impact assessments (EIAs), benefit-sharing, capacity-building and technology transfer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The 30x30 campaign, which is a global movement to protect at least 30% of the ocean by 2030 through a network of MPAs. The campaign is supported by various countries, organizations and celebrities, and aims to secure a commitment at the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) meeting in 2024.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Blue Prosperity Coalition (BPC), which is a partnership between governments, NGOs, scientists and businesses to support ocean conservation and sustainable development. The BPC provides technical assistance, funding and expertise to help countries design and implement comprehensive ocean plans that balance protection with economic growth.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Deep-sea mining is a looming threat to the ocean commons that could have devastating consequences for marine life and human well-being. It is imperative that we act now to prevent this new frontier of exploitation from opening up before it is too late. We need to protect our ocean as a common heritage of humankind and a source of life for all
