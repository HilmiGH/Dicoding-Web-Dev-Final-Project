                    Jellyfish are ancient and diverse animals that have been around for more than 500 million years. They belong to two phyla: Cnidaria, which includes true jellyfish, box jellyfish and sea anemones; and Ctenophora, which includes comb jellies. They have simple body plans, consisting of a bell-shaped or spherical body with tentacles, mouth, stomach and gonads. They have no brain, heart, bones or eyes, but some have light-sensitive organs or bioluminescent cells.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jellyfish blooms are events when large numbers of jellyfish gather in a certain area, usually due to favourable environmental conditions or biological triggers. Blooms can last from days to months and can cover hundreds of square kilometres. Blooms can occur naturally as part of the life cycle of some jellyfish species, which have complex reproductive strategies involving both sexual and asexual phases. Some jellyfish can produce clones of themselves by budding or splitting, while others can revert from adult to juvenile stages, creating a potentially immortal population.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is no definitive answer to this question, as there is a lack of long-term and global data on jellyfish populations and distributions. However, some studies have suggested that jellyfish blooms have become more frequent and intense in some regions over the past few decades, such as the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the East Asian seas. These regions are also affected by human activities such as overfishing, pollution, coastal development and aquaculture, which may create favourable conditions for jellyfish to thrive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Climate change is altering the physical and chemical properties of the oceans, such as temperature, salinity, pH, oxygen and currents. These changes may have direct and indirect effects on jellyfish blooms. For example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Warmer water temperatures may accelerate the growth and development of some jellyfish species, allowing them to reach sexual maturity faster and produce more offspring. Warmer water may also extend the blooming season or enable some species to expand their geographic range.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lower oxygen levels may reduce the competition and predation pressure on jellyfish, as they can tolerate hypoxic conditions better than most fish and invertebrates. Low oxygen may also affect the metabolism and behaviour of jellyfish, making them more active and voracious.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ocean acidification may affect the calcification and shell formation of some marine organisms that are prey or competitors of jellyfish, such as corals, molluscs and crustaceans. This may reduce their abundance and diversity, leaving more space and resources for jellyfish.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Changes in ocean currents may alter the transport and dispersal of jellyfish larvae and adults, as well as their prey and predators. This may create new opportunities for colonization or invasion of new habitats or regions by jellyfish.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Jellyfish blooms can have significant impacts on marine ecosystems, affecting the structure, function and diversity of food webs. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Jellyfish can consume large amounts of plankton, fish eggs and larvae, small fish and invertebrates, reducing the availability of food for other marine organisms. They can also compete with fish for food resources, especially in overfished areas where fish stocks are depleted.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Jellyfish can affect the behaviour and distribution of fish and marine mammals, by creating physical barriers or chemical deterrents. Some jellyfish can sting or injure their predators with their venomous cells or sharp spines, causing pain, paralysis or death.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Jellyfish can alter the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in the ocean, by consuming organic matter and releasing inorganic nutrients through excretion or decomposition. They can also transfer carbon to deeper waters through vertical migration or sinking after death.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Jellyfish blooms can also have negative consequences for human activities that depend on or interact with the ocean, such as fisheries, tourism, recreation, energy production and transportation. For example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Jellyfish can reduce the catch and quality of fish and shellfish, by preying on them directly or indirectly, or by contaminating them with toxins or pathogens. They can also damage fishing gear and equipment by clogging nets or hooks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Jellyfish can pose a threat to human health and safety, by stinging swimmers, surfers or divers with their venomous cells. Some jellyfish stings can cause severe pain, allergic reactions or even death in rare cases.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Jellyfish can interfere with coastal infrastructure and operations, by blocking the intake pipes or cooling systems of power plants, desalination plants or industrial facilities. They can also affect the navigation and communication of ships or submarines by entangling propellers or cables.
